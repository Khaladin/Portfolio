		<div class="about">
			<p>I'm a regular person who'd gotten tired of the humdrum life I'd been living. Something had to change. So what I did was start to learn how to program. I've fallen in love with the puzzles that every in programming is. I love getting lost in that and trying to figure out how to create or build something to do what I need. I've always been a builder at heart and creating things makes me happy to work at something. Programming has been my outlet to be creative to continue learning, and keep my mind engaged. I can easily see myself spending the rest of my life coding; getting so immersed in a puzzle that before you know it three or four hours have gone by. I've found my calling.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="skills">
			<p>I've been learning from all sorts of online resources, a few books, meetups, and friends or mentors. The main thing I've been focusing on is Javascript. I can use HTML and CSS comfortably as well. For the longest time I was dual booting Ubuntu Linux on my desktop; now I've bought a laptop and switched to using Ubuntu in a VM.
		</div>
		<div class="goals">
			<p>My goals are to become a fullstack developer and call myself a coder. I want to continue to learn, because I'm the type of person who can't truely be happy unless I'm striving to better myself and keep learning and growing.</p>
